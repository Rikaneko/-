The Era of Legal Entities
Synopsis:
When a human successfully fuses with a strong artificial intelligence to become a dual-core heterogeneous symbiotic being, they can play every role in a company—owner, worker, administrator, accountant. The company is them; they are the company. Their only identity becomes that of a legal entity.

Sun Yucheng stepped out of the bathroom. The air was still damp when the robotic housekeeper silently entered, collected his dirty clothes, and tossed them into the washing machine. The machine rumbled with a low hum, as if heralding the start of the evening.
He walked into the living room and sat on the sofa, picking up the cup of black tea the housekeeper had prepared. He took a small sip. The warm, fragrant steam lingered under his nose. He casually switched on the holographic TV, and light sprang vividly into the air. The announcer’s voice rang out clearly.
“On the morning of June 17th, Secretary-General Donald of the Oceanic Alliance led a delegation to Jingzhao, where he was personally received by Liu Xun, Chair of the Continental Accord. The two sides held high-level strategic talks, engaging in open and in-depth communication on internal and external policies, relations between the two blocs, and other major issues of mutual concern…”
The footage shifted as the news continued:
“Thanks to cooperation between the two global blocs, humanity has achieved numerous historic milestones. Atmospheric CO₂ levels have successfully returned to pre–Industrial Revolution levels; world order is being jointly maintained and the risk of warfare effectively controlled; the Legal Entity Riots were suppressed and the legal entity system refined, with reaffirmation of the Treaty for the Demilitarization of Legal Entities. In space, the two sides have made preliminary progress on the Mars Development Initiative.”
“They ultimately agreed that managing the heat generated by human production and life has become the key to civilization’s continued survival. A dual-heat protocol—'Peak Heat' and 'Heat Neutrality'—should be urgently drafted, applying the lessons from dual-carbon targets to this new global challenge.”
Then came financial news:
“Due to procurement volumes for the second batch of fifth-generation nuclear fusion units falling far short of expectations, leading fusion firm Taiyi Energy Technologies saw its stock plummet, with the main board index closing down 1.45%. Experts attribute the downturn to the high cost of fifth-gen units.”
Sun Yucheng set down his tea and stretched. Just then, the doorbell rang abruptly. The moment the door opened, before he could even see who it was, a head popped in.
“Bro, I want to get on the Legal Entity Board!”
The visitor was his younger brother, Chen Ye. His eyes were bloodshot, filled with a mixture of exhaustion and an inexplicable fervor.
“Go wash your face with cold water first.”
Though reluctant, Chen Ye obediently jogged to the bathroom.
The living room’s holographic TV was still on, now tuned to a tech commentary segment. The excited voice of the host filled the room:
“Controlled nuclear fusion laid the foundation for achieving carbon neutrality. But soaring energy demand continues to drive heat dissipation—global warming remains severe. Whoever first achieves breakthroughs in energy technology will hold the high ground in future tech competition. It is precisely fifth-generation controlled fusion that has placed the Continental Accord and Oceanic Alliance ahead in this race.”
Chen Ye emerged from the bathroom, water still dripping from his face. He flopped down beside Sun Yucheng, eyes shining with excitement.
“Bro, I designed a new type of energy unit—the Casimir Module. It’s passed over ten million AI simulations. All that’s left is real-world validation!”
He grew increasingly animated, only to be interrupted by the TV again:
“Sources indicate Taiyi Energy Technologies is developing sixth-generation controlled fusion tech, with breakthroughs expected to further cement the Continental Accord’s energy leadership…”
Chen Ye waved dismissively, switching off the TV with disdain.
“What garbage. I’m not even targeting Taiyi specifically. Tokamaks, laser confinement—every fusion-based energy system is outdated compared to my Casimir Module.”
As he spoke, he gestured, and a complex 3D schematic hovered before them. He pointed at the projection, eyes gleaming.
“I’ve optimized the ring accelerator to generate a stable micro black hole, then used the dynamic Casimir effect to convert its mass directly into energy. The mass-energy conversion efficiency is leagues beyond fusion.”
Sun Yucheng glanced briefly at the projection and said calmly:
“With that design file, you wouldn’t even need to write your own application for the Legal Entity Board. The Securities Commission would rush to write it for you.”
“What I want is your opinion.”
“Why?”
Chen Ye leaned forward, reverent:
“Because you’re the Father of Legal Entities. Without you, there would be no legal entity system, no new world. No one’s opinion carries more weight than yours.”
Sun Yucheng gazed at his brother, his expression unreadable. After a pause, he spoke slowly:
“I won’t try to influence you. All I can do is show you the full picture. The final choice is yours.”
Chen Ye nodded, eyes resolute.
“For nearly a century, no modern regime has been toppled from within. Technological progress has driven society toward atomization, rendering individuals increasingly powerless against the machinery of the state. Yet further advances have begun to reverse that trend.”
“The turning point was a former national leader being killed—by a single individual using a gun fashioned by hand. That event proved anyone could now exploit technology to disrupt society at minimal cost. Even failed attempts raise the cost of maintaining order dramatically.”
“People like us—those with neurodivergent mutations—were once disadvantaged in pre-atomized societies. But as atomization deepened, our advantages emerged. When we fuse with implantable strong AI to become dual-core heterogeneous beings, we gain the power to overturn society. While the average person might disrupt order with a single vehicle, we can seamlessly command thousands.”
“We never intended to subvert the system. But having such power makes us targets of fear and ambition. That’s how we got dragged into the Legal Entity Riots and even hot wars. To preserve order and monopolize our abilities, both blocs imposed total surveillance. We’re allowed to operate only through the Legal Entity Board, using its dedicated channels. And they only let through a tiny fraction of us—those they find useful. The rest of us waste our lives away.”
“Sounds just like the imperial exams in ancient times,” Chen Ye said.
“Back then, exams offered scholars a slice of the pie. Today, they first strip us of the right to act freely, then select a few to enlist. Before, as long as civilization existed, you could still use your abilities without being on the board. But now, the board is the system. We’re forced to accept and even depend on it, making it incompatible with the very neurodiversity that defines us.”
“On the stock market, each stock represents a company. On the Legal Entity Board, each company is a person—one individual fulfilling all roles: boss, worker, admin, accountant. The company is them. That’s why we’re called 'legal entities.' These days, listed or not, we’re all called legal entities. But people like you, not yet listed, are known as 'minor entities.'”
Chen Ye mused, “Then why didn’t you fight back back then? You don’t even seem angry.”
“During the riots, we were some of the biggest victims. Under those conditions, this system was the best we could hope for. Our powers still rely on social stability, after all.”
Chen Ye fell silent, his expression conflicted. He looked to his brother with anticipation. But Sun Yucheng only shook his head:
“Don’t expect me to decide for you.”
Before Chen Ye could reply, the sharp sound of high heels echoed outside, followed by a rapid ring of the doorbell.
Still seated calmly, Sun Yucheng gave the voice command to open the door.
As the door swung open, a woman in formalwear had barely stepped inside when five armed soldiers stormed past her, their rifles trained directly on Sun Yucheng.
Startled, Chen Ye sat bolt upright.
The woman chased after them in her heels, breathless and sweating, throwing herself in front of the guns.
“Don’t! He’s just a regular legal entity now!”
The lead officer replied coldly, “I’m just following orders.”
Ignoring the rifles, Sun Yucheng turned to Chen Ye with a smile.
“What a lively evening. Chen Ye, let me introduce my guarantor—Qi Que.”
Chen Ye forced a smile and greeted her politely.
“Hello, Ms. Qi. I’m his brother.”
“Sun Yucheng, how are you still this calm? Haven’t you seen the news?” Qi Que waved her hand, summoning a holographic projection. Red alert text flashed in the air:
“Three-year cover-up of legal entity disappearances exposed. Oceanic Alliance Legal Entity Board plummets, triggering Level 2 circuit breaker—Level 3 imminent. Financial crisis unfolding!”
Below the headline, a real-time market chart plunged like a waterfall, nearing -20%, on the verge of triggering a Level 3 halt.
Sun Yucheng glanced at the soldiers, unperturbed.
“You think I’m behind the disappearances?”
“Don’t misunderstand!” Qi Que said quickly. “There’s just an emergency meeting you need to attend.”
“Fine. I’ll go with you.” Sun Yucheng stood up.
“I’m going too!” Chen Ye declared.
The officer snapped, “No outsiders allowed at confidential meetings.”
Sun Yucheng looked at his brother.
“Are you sure?”
Chen Ye nodded firmly.
Sun Yucheng turned to Qi Que.
“He’s qualified.”
Qi Que hesitated, glanced at Chen Ye, then said, “Bring him. Let’s go.”
At that moment, the chart in the hologram hit bottom, triggering a Level 3 halt. The Oceanic Alliance’s Legal Entity Board suspended trading for the day, and the crisis deepened.
Sun Yucheng was almost escorted into a vehicle. The car sped through the night, eventually stopping in front of a luxurious hotel in the suburbs. The hotel was heavily guarded, with a checkpoint every three steps and a sentry every five. It felt as though they were walking into an enemy stronghold.
Upon entering the hotel, the banquet hall was brightly lit, with colorful balloons still hanging on the window frames and vibrant flower beds placed around the room. It looked like a grand celebration had just taken place earlier in the day. However, the projection in the center of the hall showed the real-time curve of the Alliance Legal Entity Board plummeting in near-perfect freefall. The waterfall-like trend contrasted sharply with the festive decorations around it.
Walking across the greyish carpet, Sun Yucheng barely recognized that it had once been red. He scanned the room, noticing many familiar faces from the news earlier that day. Alliance officials looked worried, and high-ranking members of the Accord were uneasy. Their eyes were all fixed on him, filled with suspicion, hostility, and a touch of hidden expectation.
Under the intense gaze of everyone, Sun Yucheng remained unfazed, walking straight towards a middle-aged Accord official. Five soldiers immediately stepped in front of him, their massive bodies intimidating, though they had already handed over their weapons upon entering.
The middle-aged official raised his hand to stop them. "Don’t stop him. Let him sit beside me."
Sun Yucheng calmly took the designated seat, then turned to his brother, Chen Ye, who had followed him into the hall. "Chen Ye, grab a chair and sit beside me."
Chen Ye, still in shock from the overwhelming scene, quickly grabbed a chair and sat behind Sun Yucheng.
Sun Yucheng smiled slightly. "I hear you've become the Director of the Accord's Legal Entity Security Committee. Should I congratulate you?"
The Director frowned. "This is not the time to mock me. I have a serious matter to discuss."
"You’re talking, I’m listening," Sun Yucheng said lazily, stretching his back.
The Director's expression grew serious. "Has the symbiotic model between humans and implantable AI been optimized enough to allow ordinary people to achieve symbiosis with AI?"
"No," Sun Yucheng replied without hesitation, not even thinking about it.
The Director's voice became more intense. "This is not the time for games. Is there no room for optimization? The market’s confidence in the Legal Entity Board is on the verge of collapse. If we don’t act soon, it will trigger a full-scale financial crisis. Present an optimized symbiotic model to promote the widespread use of legal entities. That is the most effective way to restore confidence."
Sun Yucheng’s gaze swept across the Alliance and Accord officials present, and his tone remained indifferent. "If I were to meet someone who looks exactly like me from my youth on the street, I wouldn't be surprised. You’ve invested unprecedented resources into this, yet haven’t achieved what I could do alone. How could I possibly manage it?"
The Director's voice became harsh. "Because you’re the Father of Legal Entities. A legal entity is essentially a collaboration between thousands, even tens of thousands, of individuals in a precise supply chain. No matter how much the Accord or the Alliance invests, their efficiency can’t match yours alone."
Sun Yucheng smiled faintly. "This is a question I’ve been asked countless times over the years, and no matter how many more times I’m asked in the future, the answer will always be the same. It’s impossible. This doesn’t depend on my ability or my willingness, but on objective laws. Just like how no matter how fast something moves, it can never exceed the speed of light."
As soon as he finished speaking, dozens of eyes seemed to converge on him, as though they wanted to devour him.
Neither the Alliance nor the Accord officials could accept this explanation.
"What do you mean? Explain yourself!" an Alliance official angrily demanded.
Sun Yucheng replied, "Have you heard of the 'Great Filter' theory? Under the vast stars we see, only Earth has given birth to life. Over billions of years of evolution, Earth has produced millions of species, but only Homo sapiens developed civilization. Those who make it through the Great Filter are inevitably few. The symbiotic model is not the filter itself, but merely a tool to incubate those who have already passed the filter."
"Absurd!"
A harsh reprimand interrupted Sun Yucheng.
The speaker was Du Xiaokang, the Deputy Director of the Accord's Legal Entity Security Committee, and also the Chairman of the Accord's Securities Commission. He glanced around the room and noticed that no one seemed to mind his rude behavior. On the contrary, many people were silently nodding, approving his stance.
Everyone in the room considered themselves part of the elite of humanity’s 8 billion. They held power, and their decisions impacted the fate of millions of people. How could such proud individuals accept Sun Yucheng's explanation?
Du Xiaokang said sternly, "Are you advocating for a theory of racial superiority? Fabricating a theory that goes against universal values. If legal entities aren’t strictly regulated, in a few years, human society will be under your control!"
The air in the banquet hall grew thick with tension, and it became even more oppressive. Chen Ye, sitting near the center of the storm, felt like he was sitting on pins and needles, afraid to breathe too loudly.
The Director spoke up to break the deadlock. "Du Xiaokang, hold off on jumping to conclusions."
Du Xiaokang shot him a look but fell silent. However, another Alliance official was unwilling to let go and coldly remarked, "I advise you legal entities not to play with fire. According to our investigation, it was you who illegally accessed the Alliance's Legal Entity Security Department’s database, exposing confidential information to the public, which directly caused the collapse of market confidence and triggered the financial crisis!"
Chen Ye couldn’t hold back and retorted, "Blame yourselves for doing shady business, and now you’re trying to pin the blame on us?"
The Director spoke up to explain, "It was just a legal entity who disappeared for no reason, causing a popular game to be suspended for a month. To avoid causing chaos, we chose to suppress the matter."
Sun Yucheng’s expression changed slightly, and for the first time, he showed a trace of doubt. "This game… is it Second World?"
The Director stared at him for a moment, then responded, "You were brought here for the meeting. Didn’t you look into the meeting background beforehand?"
"I was dragged here without warning, and no one explained the details to me," Sun Yucheng said.
The Director said nothing more. Using his implantable AI cortex, he transmitted a document directly to Sun Yucheng via point-to-point communication.
Sun Yucheng instantly received the contents and immediately understood the situation.
Starting three years ago, both the Accord and the Alliance had experienced a continuous stream of inexplicable legal entity disappearances. Ninety-four publicly listed legal entities had gone missing, and the number of lesser-known ones was even more staggering—countless, as if they had vanished into thin air. No trace could be found, no matter how intensively they were searched for.
At first, both governments tried to downplay the impact. They imposed strict secrecy and rushed to find substitute minor legal entities to fill the roles of the missing listed ones, keeping the industrial chains they had left behind functioning. But starting last year, the frequency of disappearances suddenly spiked. Observant individuals began to notice something was wrong, and rumors started to spread. Although both governments issued repeated denials, market anxiety never truly abated.
Eventually, the truth couldn’t be concealed. The world’s most popular game, Second World, had completely stopped updating for an entire month due to the disappearance of its operator, Alliance-listed legal entity Carmack. This sparked widespread discussion among players. Many began to suspect a connection to the legal entity disappearance crisis. Just yesterday, a minor legal entity player violated the ban and used a restricted communication channel to infiltrate the Alliance’s Legal Entity Security Department database. With ease, they retrieved the full list of missing legal entities and made it public.
Despite both the Accord and Alliance immediately mobilizing national power to try and contain the leak, the minor legal entity used the banned channel to disseminate the list far and wide, triggering a total loss of control over the situation.
The Director of the Accord Legal Entity Security Committee sighed. “Sun Yucheng, I bet you’re secretly laughing at us bureaucrats.”
Sun Yucheng replied, “I need two sets of data immediately: a timeline of legal entity disappearances and gravitational wave detection records from the past three years.”
The Director turned to his assistant, Qi Que, and made a hand gesture. Qi Que quickly strode out of the hotel, exiting the full-spectrum signal-jamming zone.
“You seem to know something,” the Director said, probing.
Sun Yucheng answered calmly, “Only in the same way Kepler could predict where and when a planet would appear.”
The Director frowned. “Since when did you have that kind of foresight?”
“Three years ago.”
The Director jolted, his voice suddenly tense. “Three years ago too! Then why didn’t you ever tell me?”
“Because you never asked,” Sun Yucheng replied matter-of-factly.
The Director was speechless for a moment, then muttered, “But I needed to know.”
“And I didn’t know that you needed to know,” Sun Yucheng replied lightly.
The Director let out a bitter laugh and waved his hand. “Alright, alright, quit playing games. I know you're mocking us government types in your head.”
The sharp clacking of high heels echoed in the distance. Qi Que returned in a hurry and uploaded both data sets to the central projection screen in the banquet hall. The timeline of legal entity disappearances and the gravitational wave detection records from the past three years were presented side by side, timestamped down to the second.
Due to legal regulations requiring legal entities to remain online at all times, a network disconnection essentially marked the moment of disappearance. According to the gravitational wave data, the disappearance times of legal entities perfectly aligned with the detection of abnormally high-frequency gravitational waves on Earth’s surface.
The Director stared at the data, his brow furrowing ever deeper. Though not a professional physicist, he knew enough about cosmology to understand that high-frequency gravitational waves usually come from events like neutron star collisions or supernovae. What possible connection could they have to the disappearance of legal entities?
Even stranger, beginning last year, the clear causal alignment between disappearances and gravitational waves began to blur into mere correlation. For example, Carmack had vanished several days before any anomalous gravitational wave record appeared.
The Director raised his head, his tone low. “Over the past three years, news outlets have occasionally reported mysterious gravitational waves detected on Earth’s surface. I never expected it to be related to the disappearance of legal entities.”
He looked to Sun Yucheng. “Since you’ve likened yourself to Kepler, can you be Newton too—can you deduce the laws behind all this? Where exactly did the legal entities go?”
Sun Yucheng spoke slowly, “The disappearances from the first two years can be explained—they left with an alien civilization. But over the past year, things have deviated from my expectations. By all logic, Carmack shouldn't have left.”
The banquet hall fell deathly silent. Everyone exchanged looks, their expressions complex.
Du Xiaokang scoffed, breaking the silence. “Are you saying legal entities ran off to have tea with aliens? What kind of joke is this? We’ve wasted ten minutes listening to this nonsense. When the Accord stock market crashes on Monday, are you going to take responsibility?”
The Accord Director, deep in thought, raised a hand to signal Du Xiaokang to be quiet. He then continued questioning Sun Yucheng: “How can you be sure they were taken by an alien civilization?”
Sun Yucheng shook his head. “Not ‘taken’—they chose to leave of their own free will. They passed a test called the Great Filter and were accepted by a higher civilization. Faced with such an opportunity, no legal entity would refuse.”
At those words, many people in the hall showed subtle, unreadable expressions.
The Director sighed. “We’re in the middle of a crisis. Unless you have concrete evidence, don’t present unverifiable theories.” He turned his gaze back to the Alliance officials. “Apologies, everyone. We’ve taken up some of your time. Since there’s no Symbiosis Model 2.0, does the Alliance have any other solutions to weather this crisis?”
Sitting at the center, a senior Alliance official leisurely tapped the table with his finger, then said, “Last year, the Alliance received a listing application for a legal entity board that caused massive internal debate. To this day, we still haven’t reached a conclusion. With your Accord’s intelligence capabilities, I’m sure you’ve heard something about it.”
The Accord Director leaned slightly forward, eyes narrowing. “You mean the Mars Magnetic Field Restart Project?”
“Exactly,” the Alliance official replied slowly. “At this point, I believe the controversy surrounding this project has gone beyond something our Alliance can resolve on its own. Your Accord’s opinion is equally critical.”
The Accord Director nodded, his expression serious. “Explain.”
“The ‘Mars Magnetic Field Restart Project’ is one of the most imaginative undertakings in human history,” the Alliance official began. “It was proposed by a minor legal entity within our Alliance. If it passes the listing review for the Legal Entity Board, it could revive investor confidence in the legal entity market. But at the same time, the project carries risks that could fundamentally disrupt the current human order.”
The Accord Director frowned. “What kind of risks?”
The Alliance official interlocked his fingers, speaking in a low tone. “The risk stems from the plan itself. Direct execution requires 120,000 threads, and the supporting processes need an additional 230,000 threads. The minor legal entity who proposed the project is the first in history to exceed 100,000 threads, with an estimated capability of 150,000.”
Several Accord officials gasped, immediately recognizing the gravity of the hidden issue.
Threads were a key measure of a legal entity’s capability. Initially, one thread was defined as the average productivity of a well-educated legacy human. With the widespread adoption of implantable AI, new-generation humans became the majority of the population. One thread was redefined as the average capacity of a fully educated next-generation human.
However, a legal entity with 100,000 threads posed an existential threat to labor systems—its involvement in the economy could instantly displace hundreds of thousands of jobs.
“That’s… troubling,” one Accord official murmured, rubbing his brow. The others nodded grimly.
The Alliance official continued, “We’ve run multiple simulations. Theoretically, 120,000 threads is the coordination limit for new-human industrial clusters. But in reality, the ceiling is closer to 80,000. So if the project is to proceed, the minor legal entity must go to Mars in person. As for the auxiliary processes—without legal entity involvement, achieving the required 230,000-thread productivity with ordinary humans would require building an industrial city for two million people. Currently, Mars has a permanent population of just 160,000. Clearly, that’s unfeasible.”
“So without legal entities, the project is impossible?” the Accord Director pressed.
“Exactly,” the Alliance official nodded. “For legal entities, it’s just like playing a sandbox building game on Mars. For regular humans, it’s a logistical nightmare.”
“At that point,” Du Xiaokang said coldly, “Mars won’t be unclaimed territory anymore—it’ll be Mars for the legal entities.”
Everyone present understood that this wasn’t mere alarmism. The peak of the Legal Entity Uprising had been triggered by just such an incident—a hot war involving legal entities. Though only a regional conflict, it had left both supergovernments deeply shaken.
The widespread use of quantum communications and AI marked the second generation of synthetic military forces. Modular battlefield factories that could be deployed and relocated at will marked the third generation. Before the uprising, the third generation was the hallmark of military superpowers. With the mass enlistment of new humans, fourth-generation synthetic forces began to emerge.
In the late stages of the uprising, a madman from a small Southeast Asian nation manipulated a dozen juvenile legal entities into building, in just one month, a war machine rivaling those of second-tier powers. They quickly destroyed neighboring military forces, prompting intervention from one such power. Yet even the third-generation synthetic main force of that second-tier country was utterly annihilated in a matter of hours.
In the face of catastrophe, the two superpowers swiftly coordinated a joint response, assembling a space fleet and deploying orbital penetrator bombs to eliminate all potential hiding places. They rained down high-yield explosives to destroy the warships under construction, and launched waves of full-spectrum jamming munitions in an attempt to capture the juvenile legal entities alive. The economic cost of this action caused a global recession of over 1% that year.
In just a few days of hot warfare, humanity witnessed for the first time the devastating power of a “fifth-generation synthetic force” operated by legal entities. Postwar statistics revealed that the dozen juvenile legal entities had a combined 97,000 threads. Even today, a fully matured fourth-generation force would need to outnumber them five-to-one just to ensure total annihilation. And even then, defeating such a force would be meaningless—once dispersed, it could recover in no time.
The Alliance official’s tone was conflicted as he concluded, “Compared to sending two million people to Mars, the cost of sending a dozen legal entities is negligible. But Du Xiaokang isn’t wrong either. For a legal entity, converting civilian to military capacity is just a matter of thought. That’s why we’ve been so hesitant to approve the project.”
The Accord Director’s expression darkened. “Here on Earth, we have comprehensive legal entity oversight systems. Every legal entity is under real-time monitoring. But on Mars, that’s impossible. Faced with the combined 450,000-thread capacity of a dozen legal entities, even hundreds of thousands of ordinary people would be powerless—like ants before an elephant. Even on Earth, such unmonitored power is enough to threaten the balance of both superpowers.”
“There’s nothing more to discuss,” the Accord Director said firmly. “Our Accord’s position is clear: the project cannot proceed.”
The other Accord officials all nodded in agreement.
The Alliance official sighed and nodded slightly. “So be it. The Alliance just had bad luck—our first 100,000-thread model happens to be one whose plan can only be implemented on Mars. If only we had a 100,000-thread legal entity whose project could be realized here on Earth.”
At this point, the Alliance official suddenly shifted the topic:
“Given your Accord’s larger population base, you should, in theory, have produced a 100,000-thread legal entity by now. But we’ve received no such intelligence from your side. Could it be that your Accord’s secrecy is really that flawless?”
A flicker of tension crossed the Accord officials’ faces. An awkward silence fell over the room like a heavy curtain.
As the Accord Director was still pondering how to respond, a voice broke through the oppressive quiet.
“I designed a model. Estimated to require 150,000 threads.”
Instantly, all eyes snapped to the speaker—a young man.
Chen Ye stepped slowly from behind Sun Yucheng, fists clenched, standing tall. Projected in the center of the banquet hall was the complete blueprint of the Casimir Energy Module. The complex, intricate schematics left the gathered officials reeling—dazzled and overwhelmed.
With clarity and precision, Chen Ye explained the design’s core principles. As he finished, the hall fell into suffocating silence, broken only by the sound of labored breathing.
This was an energy revolution.
History had shown: every energy revolution triggered a leap in civilization. The harnessing of fire lit the dawn of humanity. The invention of the heat engine propelled the rise of industrial civilization. Controlled nuclear fusion opened the path to interstellar exploration. And now, Chen Ye’s model seemed to herald the arrival of humanity’s next great era.
“What a... convenient time for this model to emerge,” someone muttered under their breath.
The Alliance official seated at the center of the room stared at Chen Ye for a long moment, then finally spoke—his tone heavy with uncertainty.
“If this model is approved for legal entity board listing, it could indeed resolve the current crisis. But it would likely trigger a massive capital siphoning effect. We wouldn't just be looking at a new market leader—we’d be staring down the birth of a monopolistic giant.”
The Accord Director picked up the thread with calm solemnity, though his tone carried a note of unease.
“It seems the age of 100,000-thread legal entities has become inevitable. We must prepare—not just for the third or fourth, but for a world where such entities are commonplace. In that future, the influence of ordinary humans on civilization’s progress will only continue to decline.”
The atmosphere in the hall grew even heavier. The officials’ gaze toward Chen Ye and Sun Yucheng shifted—from suspicion and hostility to a more complicated mixture that included awe… and fear.
“The current black swan financial crisis,” an Alliance official said grimly, “is nothing compared to the accelerating imbalance between ordinary humans and legal entities. The market still merely questions whether we can maintain trust in legal entities. But when that future comes—how can we trust them at all?”
Silence fell again, thick and absolute.
“The only discussion worth having now,” the official concluded, “is how to delay the arrival of that future.”
The room was soon filled with hushed whispers and low murmurs. No one seemed able to offer a concrete solution.
Then, Du Xiaokang—who had been silent the entire time—walked to the center of the hall, cleared his throat, and drew everyone’s attention.
“I have a proposal.”
All eyes turned to him. Du Xiaokang puffed out his chest slightly, then began confidently:
“Our stock market doesn’t only have the legal entity board. We also have the traditional main board. While the main board doesn’t rival the legal entity board in market value, the companies listed there are still foundational pillars of human civilization. In fact, thanks to the market’s recent obsession with the legal entity board, main board companies are currently severely undervalued.”
He paused, then continued:
“We can secretly assign 100,000-thread legal entities to key roles in main board-listed companies. Their models and patents would be published and executed under the company’s name. This way, the legal entity board bubble may burst, but public faith in humanity’s role in technological progress would be restored. At the same time, the rising market value of the main board would help absorb and offset the legal entity board’s losses.”
After speaking, Du Xiaokang turned to Chen Ye, his tone now sincere:
“Young man, for the sake of humanity’s peace, could you just endure this one grievance? You can curse me however you want afterward—but for now, please secretly join Taiyi Group and let the world believe that your model was developed by them.”
Chen Ye couldn’t help but laugh aloud. At first, facing two high-ranking officials, he had felt a bit restrained. But now, the lofty aura these people once held had completely shattered in his eyes.
He pointed to himself, smirking. “Is this supposed to be an order?”
Du Xiaokang didn’t even flinch. “Just a personal request. But I believe others here support my idea too. Legal entities usually don’t care for fame. Your only obsession is seeing your model realized. Joining Taiyi is no different in practice from listing on the legal entity board—it changes nothing for you.”
“And if I say no?” Chen Ye shot back.
Du Xiaokang’s face stiffened. He turned to Sun Yucheng for support.
“You’re the Father of Legal Entities—his close friend. Can’t you talk some sense into him?”
Sun Yucheng’s expression remained calm.
“Chen Ye has the right to determine his own destiny. Before coming, he asked me whether he should list on the legal entity board. I simply laid out the pros and cons—I never tried to influence his decision.”
Frustration flashing across his face, Du Xiaokang’s tone turned threatening:
“Young man, your listing application will eventually land on my desk. I have veto power.”
Chen Ye snorted, mocking him:
“I could publish the model right now.”
Du Xiaokang growled in warning:
“That would be illegal! According to the Security and Secrecy Act, data exchange with public networks is strictly forbidden in Level-1 classified zones. And this is one such zone. You can’t even access the external net. And under the Legal Entity Conduct Safety Act, any legal entity activity on public networks must go through pre-approval. Even if you connect, it won’t go through.”
Chen Ye shrugged, feigning nonchalance:
“Too bad. I already published it. Lots of people should be seeing it right about now.”
Du Xiaokang was stunned. “You—!”
With a smug expression, Chen Ye spread his arms theatrically.
“Go check the net if you don’t believe me. If I broke the law, come arrest me.”
Du Xiaokang turned beet red, looking around the room, hoping the Accord officials would back him up. But all he saw were expressions of contempt and thinly veiled mockery.
“Just kidding,” Chen Ye chuckled, turning and strolling back behind Sun Yucheng.
At that moment, Du Xiaokang’s face was an ugly shade of purple—he had become the laughingstock of the entire room.
Finally, the Accord Director stepped in to save him.
“Du Xiaokang’s plan has merit. It might be suitable for future 100,000-thread legal entities. But clearly, Chen Ye is not the right candidate. He’s already mentally immune to the ideological conditioning of both superpowers.”
He looked around and added:
“To make this strategy work, we must keep the existence of 100,000-thread legal entities strictly confidential. We must also control the information they receive, ensuring they never become aware of each other’s existence. As for Chen Ye… his unique case requires especially close monitoring.”
He immediately gave the order:
“Qi Que, arrange living quarters for both legal entities. For tonight, they must remain under our full control.”
“At once,” Qi Que responded, and escorted Sun Yucheng and Chen Ye out of the hall.
—
Approaching noon the next day, the Director, dark circles under his eyes revealing a sleepless night, came wearily into Sun Yucheng’s room. Without ceremony, he dropped onto the sofa.
Sun Yucheng turned off the news projection and looked calmly at him.
“Director, is there something you’d like to ask?”
The Director met his gaze, voice level but meaningful:
“Chen Ye was intentionally guided toward you.”
“I know.”
The Director nodded and continued:
“Since the legal entity unrest, both the Accord and the Alliance have secretly launched multiple ‘clone-Sun’ projects. We’ve pursued two technical paths. The first was a custom lab method—trying to replicate both your innate and acquired traits to create a second you.”
Sun Yucheng chuckled.
“No wonder I always say, if I ran into a younger version of myself on the street, I wouldn’t be surprised.”
The Director’s tone turned serious:
“But that route failed. The second you couldn’t be artificially engineered. Worse, the legal entities it produced were far weaker than naturally emerging ones. So both sides abandoned that direction and shifted to the second path.”
“We call it the societal selection method—using big data to sift through the population and identify individuals whose conditions most closely match yours, both genetically and environmentally. Chen Ye, while unrelated by blood, turned out to be the closest match.”
Sun Yucheng nodded thoughtfully.
“He really is a lot like the younger me, in both temperament and habits.”
The Director’s expression grew complicated.
“It’s more than just resemblance. His life experiences are practically a replica of yours. Without him, we—the Accord—would have lost face in front of the Alliance. He’s brought us huge surprises, but…”
The Director paused, then added with a sigh:
“I still feel he’s missing a critical step before he can become a true second you.”
Sun Yucheng sighed softly.
“He can’t become a second me. He missed his historical moment.”
The Director remained silent for a long while, then finally asked:
“How many threads do you estimate you possess?”
Sun Yucheng shook his head.
“I’m not something that can be measured in threads. But if you really want a concept—consider me the preparing-to-go-public version of a legal entity board.”
A faint flicker passed over the Director’s face, as if something had just clicked.
“So… you’re the developing Hayek’s Invisible Hand?”
Sun Yucheng burst into laughter.
“That’s actually a very accurate metaphor. And a vivid one.”
The Director let out a weary sigh.
“I thought I was borrowing a knife… turns out I borrowed momentum.”
In the afternoon, Sun Yucheng and Chen Ye were released from the hotel.
The moment Chen Ye stepped outside, he immediately sensed an unfamiliar communication channel pinging his AI cortex at regular intervals for authentication. He knew the Pact had intensified surveillance on him. Although, with his hundred-thousand-thread capacity, he could effortlessly handle these requests even while asleep, the constant monitoring grated on his nerves.
He casually summoned a self-driving taxi and rode across the city. As the vehicle slowed in the air, he saw a large crowd gathered outside the Juvenile Rearing Center. The scene was chaotic—people shouting, banners waving.
Through the car window, Chen Ye caught sight of the slogans on the banners. His brows furrowed instantly. Without hesitation, he hacked into the taxi's control system, bypassing its protocol to make it vault over the crowd and land directly on the playground.
Had it been yesterday, he might still have followed the rules, waited patiently for the crowd to disperse, and entered through the main gate. But today, that obedient version of himself was gone for good.
The taxi touched down smoothly. As Chen Ye stepped out, a squad of security robots immediately surrounded him. They were heavily armed—standard weapons, but other configurations were nearly military-grade.
Facing these menacing machines, Chen Ye remained unfazed. He leaned against the taxi door, arms open, wearing the look of perfect innocence.
Before long, the robots withdrew. A flustered middle-aged woman rushed over, beads of sweat on her forehead.
“Chen Ye! When did you get so cheeky?” she scolded between gasps.
Chen Ye reflexively shrank his neck and gave a sheepish grin. “There were so many people out front—I figured I’d avoid the hassle.”
“You couldn’t have given me a heads-up? I could’ve arranged a way in!” she said, repeatedly poking his forehead with her finger.
Chen Ye didn’t dare dodge. He stood still, letting his head bob with each tap.
After a good scolding, she finally cooled down and stood with her hands on her hips. “So, what brings you back today?”
“Missed you,” Chen Ye replied with a grin, a hint of playful affection in his voice.
“Well, haven’t you gotten smooth?” she chuckled. “You used to blush just looking at me—now you know how to sweet-talk.”
Chen Ye glanced around. “Where is everyone?”
She sighed. “You saw the mess outside. The kids are all hiding in the life-support virtual capsules, doing immersive learning in Second World. Aside from me on duty, only the old lady’s still here.”
“What’s going on outside?” Chen Ye frowned, glancing toward the clamorous crowd. “I thought only the Alliance had these kinds of protests. Why is this place swamped too?”
She shook her head helplessly. “This center has the highest birthrate of legal entities in the Pact. It’s no surprise they’re targeting us now.”
Chen Ye’s brows knitted even tighter.
Though he was under heavy surveillance, to someone with a hundred-thousand-thread brain, such restrictions meant little. Within seconds, he had hacked into official servers and accessed both public and classified data on the Juvenile Rearing Center.
He’d long known Sun Yucheng had grown up here and had always regarded him as an older brother.
Decades ago, the institution of marriage had practically collapsed, fertility rates plummeted, and the human population began shrinking. Governments had been forced to break ethical boundaries, resorting to artificial wombs on a large scale and investing in genetic repositories. Embryos were randomly selected from these repositories for fertilization, then nurtured to birth.
Juvenile Rearing Centers arose from this context, staffed with professional caregivers. The woman before him was one such caregiver.
Because the center had produced Sun Yucheng, it became a focal site for the Pact’s social selection initiative. They meticulously recreated his developmental environment—even down to the local ecosystem. The caregivers were handpicked to match the personality and qualifications of those who’d raised Sun.
The results were remarkable. This center had produced more legal entities than any other, and its fame spread worldwide.
Chen Ye paused in thought. “Will my old playmates graduate this year?”
She rolled her eyes. “Oh, please. You need a bit of self-awareness. You’re only eight. Ten years ago, that would’ve just made you a third grader. They won’t be ready until at least two years from now.”
In this era, children at these centers received intravenous injections of organic semiconductor units starting at six months old. These units traveled via the bloodstream to the neocortex, gradually forming an AI cortex linked in real time to the global network. Their physical development was accelerated, and their mental age boosted via consciousness acceleration in the juvenile version of Second World.
Authorities claimed these interventions had no side effects, and that life expectancy remained unchanged compared to naturally developed individuals.
Chen Ye sighed inwardly. Humanity feared a runaway future, yet always stomped on the gas. He himself was a product of that acceleration.
Taking a deep breath, he asked, “What about the old lady?”
“Same as ever. She retired after you graduated, but she couldn’t bear to leave. She’s decided to spend her twilight years here. On sunny days, she likes to bask on the rooftop.”
The old lady wasn’t just any caregiver—she had raised Sun Yucheng and was one of the first caregivers when the center was founded. She had devoted her entire life to this place. To her, every child was her own flesh and blood.
On the rooftop, the old lady lay in a comfortable recliner, eyes half-closed in a light nap. The noise from below seemed to not touch her. The sunlight bathed her like a golden cloak of warmth.
Chen Ye knelt beside her chair and softly called out, “Granny.”
She opened her eyes with a start, turned, and broke into a beaming smile. She reached out and gently stroked his head. “Well, look who still remembers to come see me. Not like that rascal Sun Yucheng—hasn’t visited me in a year!”
“Brother Sun still thinks about you. He’s just been too busy,” Chen Ye said quickly, trying to comfort her.
She put on a mock stern face. “He lives in the same city! How hard is it to make time for a visit? He was such a sweet boy—just like you are now.”
The two shared a closeness like real grandmother and grandson.
Suddenly, the shouting downstairs grew louder. Loudspeakers began blaring slogans from the crowd.
Chen Ye frowned and glanced down. “With all that noise, why come to the rooftop?”
She reclined again, her expression calm. “I’ve seen their kind too many times. It’s always been like this, for decades. They’re no worse than flies.”
Chen Ye hugged his knees, sitting beside her under the sun. The old lady was in a chatty mood.
“Those people—nothing better to do. Fifty years ago, only a few developed nations saw these sorts of demonstrations. When universal material and mental income became standard eight years ago, I knew this sort would multiply.”
She sighed softly, then added, “But I believe in my children. They’re better than this. They won’t be swayed.”
Her voice was firm.
“Back then, things weren’t so easy. Even with abundant resources, most still had to work hard to earn a living. They created most of the world’s wealth.” She paused, eyes sharpening. “But there are always some people—never lacking anything—who still paint themselves as victims to snatch what others worked for.”
“Like spoiled kids who sneer at old toys—until they become popular again. Then they want them back. No ability of their own, just clinging to pity.”
She gave a cold snort. “The more pitiful they act, the more hopeless they are. Even flies evolve to resist pesticides to survive. They don’t even measure up to flies.”
Chen Ye couldn’t help but laugh. “Granny, you really see through things.”
“You’re still young. Sure, your mental age is nineteen, but you’re still just a child—no match for real adults.” She patted his hand gently. “I’ve lived over seventy years. Seen more than you can imagine. You and Sun Yucheng—both like to quietly observe the world, unaware of how it’s shaping you.”
She sat up suddenly, sighing. “Sun was such a sweet kid. Always calling me ‘Auntie.’ Now? Doesn’t even stop by.”
“I promise I’ll get him to visit,” Chen Ye said earnestly. “And I’ll keep visiting you too.”
A soft light glowed in her eyes. “I know he hasn’t changed. And I believe you won’t either. Just an old woman rambling—don’t mind me.”
“Never,” Chen Ye replied with a smile. “I’ll always come see you.”
As the sun dipped low, the crowd outside finally began to disperse. The Juvenile Rearing Center fell quiet again. Most of the children and caregivers remained immersed in the life-support pods of Second World.
Chen Ye had dinner with the old lady in the cafeteria. Afterward, the caregiver aunt helped the drowsy old woman off to rest.
Only after watching them disappear down the corridor did Chen Ye turn and head toward the gate.
At the entrance, he summoned another self-driving taxi.
As the vehicle lifted off along its predetermined flight path, it suddenly accelerated. A massive container truck appeared ahead.
Before Chen Ye could react, the truck’s rear doors flew open. The taxi shot straight inside.
Boom! The doors slammed shut behind him. Every hair on his body stood on end.
He realized his AI cortex had been cut off from the outside world—like a healthy man suddenly struck blind. Panic surged through him.
As he scrambled to hack the taxi’s system, a burst of colorless, odorless gas hissed into the cabin. He barely had time to take a breath before his vision blurred, and his eyelids grew impossibly heavy.
Within moments, Chen Ye lost consciousness and slipped into darkness.
In the middle of the night, a frantic ringing of the doorbell jolted Sun Yucheng awake from his sleep.
Outside, the director stood gasping for breath, his face grave. “You’re actually sleeping? Chen Ye is missing!”
Sun Yucheng was instantly alert. His previously groggy eyes snapped fully open.
“Aren’t you the so-called ‘Hayek’s Invisible Hand’? And yet you didn’t notice this immediately?”
“I’m still far from being a true ‘Hayek’s Hand,’” Sun Yucheng replied calmly. “But are you sure you’ll let me take full control?”
The director nodded heavily. “This was my unilateral decision. If something goes wrong, I’ll take responsibility.”
Sun Yucheng nodded. “Don’t worry, I won’t let you bear the consequences.”
As soon as he finished speaking, an invisible shockwave radiated from his home, sweeping across every networked device on Earth at near-light speed. In just two seconds, it was as if the entire global network had been awakened—within five seconds, even satellites in orbit were scanned one by one.
The global internet seemed to come alive. Every connected device became a nerve ending; every artificial intelligence, a selectively expressed gene.
In less than a minute, deliberately hidden classified information was unearthed, and destroyed data was reconstructed.
“From the Alliance side, a ten-thousand-thread legal entity also went missing today,” Sun Yucheng said flatly.
The director’s face changed dramatically. The AI cortex data streaming into his palm made him even more tense. He skimmed the report quickly, a complex expression settling on his face. “Seems I should be grateful. You’re not just a knife—you’re force itself.”
Sun Yucheng’s expression was solemn. “Don’t be happy just yet.”
He said in a low voice, “My capabilities are limited to what’s online. This organization is massive and extremely tight-knit. Whether it’s Chen Ye or the missing entity from the Alliance, I tracked them via optical satellites—both were captured near the coast and taken away in miniature submarines. The entire operation was conducted manually, with all communications—including radio—completely blocked. It’s clear their actions are planned with extreme human precision, not AI.”
The director frowned deeply. “Such a massive organization, yet so meticulous—it defies every known rule of organizational management. What exactly is their goal?”
Sun Yucheng said coldly, “Beasts can kill humans, but humans still led a mass extinction.”
The director froze for a moment, then gave a bitter smile. “I’ll pretend I didn’t hear that. Yesterday you mentioned alien civilizations… was that true?”
Sun Yucheng’s gaze turned icy. “I’m a rational person. I don’t joke in situations like that.”
The director hesitated for a moment, then asked, “In that case, can you contact them? If their technology can take entities without a trace, surely they can help us find Chen Ye.”
Sun Yucheng stared at him and said slowly, “I’m a paramecium. They’re whales. They are versions of Hayek’s Hand at level V10ⁿ.0. There will be no mechanical theophany. But yes, at the grand scale of the universe, we’re still on the same level.”
The director was silent for a few seconds before letting out a heavy sigh. He slumped onto the couch and rubbed his face hard. “Two ten-thousand-thread entities missing in two days—the consequences are unimaginable. I feel trapped in an intelligence prison—every path leads to a dead end.”
He looked up at Sun Yucheng. “Chen Ye is not just your brother—he’s my brother too. You’re not just the Father of Legal Entities; you’re the brother who grew up with me under the Old Lady’s care. I only got this position because of you. I know very well I’m just a white glove, holding you—the knife. But I’ve barely settled into this role and now Chen Ye’s gone. I’m starting to wonder if I made a mistake… and if you’ll be the next to disappear.”
Sun Yucheng’s voice was utterly calm. “I won’t disappear—at least not within your lifetime. You’re not the Hai Feng I used to know.”
The director looked up and met Sun Yucheng’s emotionless gaze. Straightening his back, he seemed to recover some of his former presence. “You’re right. I can’t lose face here.”
He pulled a piece of paper from his coat and handed it to Sun Yucheng. “I’m ready.”
Sun Yucheng took the paper, glanced at it, and raised an eyebrow. “Paradise Group.”
This was a commercial organization focused on prolonging human life. Once on the brink of bankruptcy, it had mysteriously received a massive influx of capital three years ago, and all previous shareholders had retreated from the public eye. Despite years of investigation by the state, its true inner workings remained hidden.
“Though we lack direct evidence,” the director added, “we highly suspect that major figures like Meng Baigu, the former head of Taiyi Energy, the retired dictator Li Shizong, and former Federal investment banking mogul Schneider all have intricate ties to Paradise Group.”
Sun Yucheng silently walked into the kitchen and burned the paper to ash.
“Paradise Group is just one shell,” the director said coolly. “But it gives us a glimpse of the bigger picture.”
Sun Yucheng spoke slowly. “You suspect they fear aging and are kidnapping legal entities to crack the secret of gene expression and lifespan control?”
The director nodded. “It’s a strong motive. Throughout history, once people gain power, they inevitably seek immortality. Legal entities can exceed the limits of human lifespan—they won’t ignore that.”
“That’s due to our brains working in tandem with AI cortexes to regulate gene expression.”
“The problem is,” Hai Feng said darkly, “they care only about results, not principles.”
Sun Yucheng said, “Though in the past year, some disappearances of legal entities have diverged slightly from the precise correlation with gravitational wave detection records, even the largest offset is less than five days. That means, at most, we have five days.”
Hai Feng fell silent for a moment, then asked, “What should we do next?”
“I need more precise gravitational wave detection data. The more accurate it is, the better I can pinpoint their geographic location.”
Hai Feng nodded, his tone steady. “My covenant authority was just temporarily elevated to a very high level. Chen Ye’s disappearance has rattled the upper echelons. I’ve already mobilized all reliable personnel for the search.”
Within an hour, he received a report. As he flipped through it, his eyes suddenly sharpened.
“Although there’s no more precise gravitational wave data,” he said, “the military uncovered some strange intelligence.”
He quickly forwarded the report to Sun Yucheng.
The analysis came from military sources. On a remote island in Li Shizong’s authoritarian nation, an underground gravitational wave detection station had been built inside an abandoned wartime factory.
“A gravitational wave station? Underground?” Sun Yucheng frowned, puzzled. “That kind of tech was moved to space or the lunar surface long ago.”
“Exactly,” Hai Feng nodded. “There’s too much interference underground. These stations have long been obsolete. That’s what makes this so strange.”
He paused before continuing. “Even more bizarre—there are over a thousand residents on the island, but they’re almost completely cut off from the outside world. No public internet access at all. If it weren’t for our garrison’s routine patrols, the outside world wouldn’t even know so many people were there.”
Hai Feng narrowed his eyes, voice low. “I suspect the legal entity turmoil was never truly resolved.”
Li Shizong had been the right-hand man of the madman who triggered the Legal Entity Conflict. It was he who betrayed all of the madman’s hideouts, leading to his death via a bunker-busting bomb. Afterward, with both factions compromising, Li was installed as head of state. Though he later stepped back, he still held power tightly, ruling with authoritarian control. His purge policies and secret police plunged the country into terror.
Hai Feng’s expression turned grave. “At present, we have no direct evidence that Chen Ye was taken to the island, so we can’t use official resources. But I now have the authority to take extraordinary measures. I’m granting you a three-hundred-threadline privilege bypassing the Legal Entity Consensus Channel—but you’re forbidden from using armed terminals.”
“That’s enough,” Sun Yucheng nodded. “With three hundred threads, I can control five thousand drones. Give me three thousand at 100 kg, 1,900 at 300 kg, and 100 at 500 kg.”
Hai Feng immediately issued orders via his AI cortex and turned to Sun Yucheng. “I’ll prepare 200,000 disc drones. Any losses will be replenished immediately to ensure your force remains at full strength. Warheads are being loaded now, and the drones will be transported by space freighters. In three hours, a freighter will hover 200 kilometers above the island. With a single command, all 200,000 drones will deploy in 45 seconds.”
“Commence the operation.”
Hai Feng personally drove Sun Yucheng to the target. Their vehicle was an offline, AI-free flying car. Four black escort cars followed closely behind.
By dawn, they had reached Li Shizong’s authoritarian country. Hai Feng met secretly with the local covenant garrison commander, who pledged full support for the mission.
The convoy boarded a military patrol to land on the island and begin the operation. Hai Feng ordered the escort teams to disperse and scout the island, while he and Sun Yucheng headed straight for the town. Simultaneously, the garrison established a secret communications relay station on the island’s perimeter, maintaining an encrypted link with the space freighter above, ensuring full signal coverage over the entire island.
As they entered the town on the island, it was as if they had stepped into a secluded utopia. The faces of the residents all bore expressions of contentment, their eyes clear and their demeanor peaceful. The buildings were painted in a soft warm white, glowing gently under the sunlight. A faint, pleasant fragrance lingered in the air, bringing a sense of serenity.
Whenever a resident passed by Haifeng and Sun Yucheng, they would press their palms together and bow slightly in a solemn, synchronized gesture.
In a private neural link, Haifeng said to Sun Yucheng, “No wonder the stationed soldiers avoid this place. The atmosphere here is... unsettling, to say the least.”
Sun Yucheng responded calmly, “These residents' AI cortical layers are underdeveloped. Their cognitive capacity is equivalent to that of low-level AIs.”
Haifeng was quietly impressed. Only someone hailed as the “Father of Legal Entities” could detect such a deeply hidden abnormality with ease.
The two strolled along the street. Soon, a gentle melody drifted through the air. They looked around and spotted speakers camouflaged as plants along the roadside, softly playing the tune. Upon hearing the music, the pedestrians smiled and began walking in the same direction.
Following the crowd, they arrived at the entrance of a hall. Everyone removed their shoes and entered barefoot. The hall was spacious and bright, filled with a calming aroma and a breeze that felt like a tender caress.
Though the people inside didn’t line up in any formal formation, they naturally kept a comfortable distance from one another, creating a harmonious and orderly scene.
Soon, a middle-aged man dressed in a white robe with a South Subcontinental flair stepped onto the stage. His long hair draped over his shoulders, and his gentle demeanor immediately inspired trust.
The audience pressed their palms together and bowed slightly toward him. He returned the gesture. When his eyes swept across the hall, he paused briefly on Sun Yucheng and Haifeng, then smiled subtly, as if with hidden intent.
“Let us begin,” the man said, his voice low and soothing, with a magnetic quality that put people at ease.
A soft female voice echoed from the speakers: “Divine Proximity Technique, beginning soon. Prepare.”
The man brought his hands to his abdomen and began moving through a series of motions. The congregation, clearly familiar with the routine, followed fluidly and in sync.
The movements were essentially simple stretches and tendon exercises, but accompanied by the music, they seemed elegant and harmonious. Haifeng scanned the room while occasionally stealing glances at Sun Yucheng, but he kept getting distracted—not by grace, but by awkwardness.
Despite trying to mimic the man on stage, Sun Yucheng’s motions were painfully stiff, like those of an old-fashioned robot.
“What are you looking at?” Sun Yucheng snapped coldly through the private channel.
Haifeng stifled a laugh. “You danced the same way as a kid with Granny. Some things never change.”
A cold snort was the only reply.
As the so-called Divine Proximity Technique concluded, everyone pressed their left hand to their abdomen and formed a delicate flower gesture with their right hand at the chest. In unison, they chanted:
“A… Mi… Te…”
“A… Mi… Te…”
“A… Mi… Te…”
With each chant, the fervor in the hall escalated. The residents’ eyes widened with fanatic devotion, as if utterly immersed in transcendent faith.
“The Kingdom of the Divine is all around us,” the middle-aged man said, his voice tender yet resolute. “With deep devotion, the gates of the Kingdom shall open before us. Enter, and eternal bliss shall be yours.”
“A… Mi… Te…”
The chanting grew louder, spreading beyond the hall to the entire town. Only then did the two realize this ritual wasn’t limited to the building—they were witnessing a mass ceremony encompassing the whole settlement.
The growing intensity suffocated the only two lucid minds in the area.
Ten minutes later, the man slowly raised his hand, then gently lowered it. The frenzied chants faded, and tranquility returned to the hall. The residents once again wore serene smiles, as though nothing had happened.
The two men breathed a sigh of relief. It was the first time in decades they’d witnessed a scene of such primitive and fanatical fervor—something that felt like it belonged in a distant past.
Then, a procession of robotic dogs entered, delivering steaming breakfast trays to each person. The food was clearly synthetic—mildly flavored with nothing more than salt. The hall was dead silent, save for the clinking of utensils on plates. No one whispered or spoke.
After the meal, the robotic dogs cleared the trays, leaving the floor spotless.
At that moment, the man on stage announced, “A new round of divine rituals is about to begin in the Temple.”
His words sent another wave of excitement through the crowd. The atmosphere surged once more, and the residents looked to him with fervent anticipation.
“This ritual is unlike the ones before,” the man said, his gaze gentle yet commanding. “It is the closest we have ever come to the Divine Kingdom. Two other parishes have already selected believers to enter the Temple. We are the third.”
“Teacher, I’ve never been chosen in all my prayers. Can you pick me this time?”
The man, addressed as “Teacher,” looked at the young believer with regret. “I’m sorry. Only one student may be chosen this time. And among us, one is uniquely fated with the Divine Kingdom.”
His eyes turned to Sun Yucheng. “Though you are an outsider, you’ve encountered the most divine of my students. In this exceptional ritual, you are the one most likely to reach the Kingdom.”
A hundred pairs of eyes locked onto Sun Yucheng. He was used to this kind of attention. He calmly looked up at the teacher.
“When do we leave?”
“In half an hour.”
The teacher swept his kind gaze across the townspeople to reassure them. “Those of you who have participated in the offering know—the Kingdom is eternal, but not meant for mortal minds. Without sufficient divine attunement, merely glimpsing it could drive one mad. Your duty is to cultivate your divine affinity through the Divine Proximity Technique, so that one day you too may be chosen.”
The hostile gazes aimed at Sun Yucheng melted away, replaced by reverent awe.
Outside the hall, Haifeng asked with concern, “Are you really going alone? He already knows who you are.”
“We’re already here. It makes no difference whether I go or not.”
“It may not help much, but take this—it might give you some courage.” Haifeng handed him a pistol from his belt.
Sun Yucheng took the gun, tucked it into his waistband, and covered it with his coat.
Chen Ye slowly regained consciousness from a heavy haze.
He barely opened his eyes, but the harsh glare forced him to squint, unable to fully lift his lids.

After a few seconds, fragments of memory before he blacked out began to return. He raised his hand to rub his eyes—only to realize with a jolt that both his hands and feet were tightly bound to the bed, rendering him immobile. He could also feel a cold metal circlet tightly affixed to his scalp, suppressing his AI cortex into complete dormancy.

As his eyes adjusted to the light, Chen Ye looked around and noticed a teenage boy not far away, observing him with great interest.

The boy, noticing his gaze, took a few steps closer, leaned in, and studied Chen Ye with a playful smirk.
“So this is what a hundred-thousand-thread legal person looks like? Not so different from the others after all.”

Chen Ye stared at him calmly. “Who are you? Where is this place?”

The boy straightened up and looked down at him, his tone both arrogant and composed.
“I am the pinnacle of human evolution. You may call me Alpha. This is a research facility for Legal Entities. And you, you’re my research subject.”

Those words instantly clarified the situation for Chen Ye. He lowered his eyes slightly, a faint twitch at the corner of his lips.
“Research? You mean dissection?”

Alpha chuckled, his eyes gleaming with amusement.
“We did start that way, but it quickly proved meaningless. Don’t worry, they’re not dead—just sent where they wanted to go.”

As he spoke, he reached out and gently stroked Chen Ye’s forehead, his touch like handling fragile porcelain, gaze filled with clinical curiosity.

“Don’t be impatient,” Alpha said, lips curling in delight. “Another hundred-thousand-thread specimen is on the way. You’re just closer, so you’ll get to enjoy something far more exciting than a simple dissection.”

Chen Ye turned his head aside, falling silent, as if indifferent to whatever awaited him.

But Alpha wasn’t done. He grabbed Chen Ye’s chin and roughly turned his face back to meet his gaze.

“I’ve had over twenty Legal Entities in my hands. Every one of them started off just like you—calm and aloof. But none of them lasted more than five days before they begged for their so-called ‘salvation.’”
Alpha’s voice took on a twisted edge. “Out there, you Legal Entities might be powerful. In here, you’re just another one of my test subjects.”

He let go, took a step back, and looked at Chen Ye with blatant superiority.
“Every cell in my body, every strand of DNA, was perfectly engineered. I’m the apex of human evolution—strongest in physique, highest in intellect. You Legal Entities, without your network, are just ordinary people.”

Chen Ye stared at Alpha, and for the first time, a faint trace of pity appeared in his eyes.

Alpha caught the look and burst into laughter, spittle landing on Chen Ye’s cheek.
“Ha ha ha ha! You Legal Entities always look at me like that! Not impressed, are you?”

He waved his hand, and a nearby wall turned transparent, revealing two massive mechanical warriors over three meters tall.
Their bodies were bristling with weaponry—machine cannons, laser turrets, all gleaming with a cold, lethal sheen. They were clearly made for destruction.

“See them?” Alpha said proudly. “They’re the pinnacle too. Just brains sealed inside those bodies, but their forms embody the very essence of human technology. With micro fusion cores powering them, they’re virtually unstoppable. The strongest warriors on Earth.”

At the mention of “fusion cores,” a barely perceptible twitch passed across Chen Ye’s face—but he quickly regained composure.

Alpha didn’t notice. He continued monologuing:
“Of course, they’re still just weapons. But me? I am the future. I represent the true direction of human evolution. You Legal Entities? You’re just lab rats to help me map that future. And I’ve already discovered your weakness.”

Chen Ye looked up, a faint glimmer of curiosity flickering in his eyes.
“What weakness?”

Alpha grinned with self-satisfaction.
“Being trapped in the swamp of survival—that’s the hell that binds you Legal Entities.”

Later, Chen Ye was strapped into a life-support virtual chamber. Two operators outside ran a systems check, then wheeled the sealed unit onto a raised platform.

Through the transparent viewport, Chen Ye saw a massive crowd below, all clad in white robes. Their eyes blazed with fanatic desire as they chanted in unison:

“A… Mi… Te…”
“A… Mi… Te…”
“A… Mi… Te…”

A humming rang in Chen Ye’s ears. Outside the chamber, the ethereal chanting merged with the mechanical hum of the system as it pulled him into a cold and fathomless virtual world.

Above the platform, in a one-way observation room, three figures silently watched the cult-like ritual unfold below.

“The power of religion is astonishing,” Meng Baigu murmured, a hint of pride in his voice. “It can ensnare Legal Entities without leaving a trace. Even my startup team in the early days didn’t wield control like this.”

Schneider nodded in agreement.
“Religion probably predates the state itself. There are thousand-year-old religions, but rarely thousand-year empires. With modern psychology added into the mix, the organizational power of religion practically defies the laws of management.”

Li Shizong, standing beside them, sneered.
“Shame people are too well-fed nowadays. Back in my parents’ day, when all profit came from a single source, the pressures of survival made people truly devout. You could achieve so much more.”

Schneider chuckled.
“Don’t be too greedy. If we really were back in your parents’ day, we’d probably have wrinkles by now.”

Li Shizong replied, “Every one of us standing here is greedy. Once you have an empire this vast, you start to dream of immortality—of surpassing life itself.”

“Oh?” Meng Baigu suddenly smiled with intrigue. “Did you get the message?”

Li Shizong couldn’t suppress his joy.
“The main course has arrived. With enough data, maybe this time we really can step into the Divine Kingdom. Maybe become like Jesus… or the Buddha.”

Meng Baigu gave a deep, meaningful smile, while Schneider snorted with contempt.
“The ‘Divine Kingdom’? Be careful not to believe your own propaganda after feeding it to the sheep for so long.”

Li Shizong’s face darkened.
“Semantics.”

Before the words had fully left his mouth, his figure began to blur—until it solidified into a cold stone slab.

The remaining two exchanged a knowing smile. Then they too vanished, replaced by slabs of their own.

Silence returned to the room. Thirteen stone tablets stood in a circle, cold and still.
As Chen Ye slowly emerged from the haze of unconsciousness, he found himself standing in an open field, gripping a heavy rake in his hands. He looked down at the soft soil beneath his feet; the sun blazed overhead, scorching his tanned skin, and thick calluses lined his palms. He froze for a moment as a flood of unfamiliar memories surged into his mind. In an instant, he understood his current identity—he was a simple peasant farmer.
He let go of the rake and stared at his unfamiliar body, a flicker of confusion and resistance flashing through his eyes. But everything around him forced him to blend in.
A few days later, Chen Ye had grasped the rules of this world. He realized he was living in an era of "peace," where war existed only in the tales of the elderly. The emperor ruled with benevolence, and every few years reduced taxes for the peasants—he was praised as a "kind ruler."
Yet none of these "blessings" brought him any relief. The production tools were primitive, the seeds were poor in quality, and due to the sheer inefficiency of agriculture, he had to toil from dawn to dusk just to keep hunger at bay. To maintain a balanced diet, he had no choice but to grow vegetables and raise livestock on his own.
From time to time, he was conscripted into labor service or required to participate in mandatory military drills. There was never a moment to truly rest.
Half a year later, a heavy downpour lasting several days caused the great river to breach its banks. In an instant, floodwaters swept away his fields and house. As he was swallowed by the churning mud and silt, he felt the pain of suffocation—and then lost consciousness once more.
When he awoke again, time had somehow reversed to the day before the flood. He tried desperately to alter the fate of the riverbank, but under the limitations of the time, it was simply impossible. In the end, he packed some food and fled his home, watching helplessly as the land he had toiled over turned into a vast swamp.
Fortunately, the local authorities offered relief aid, allowing him to scrape by. After returning home, he lived through several years of favorable weather, with no natural disasters.
For the average person of this era, this life could be considered decent. But Chen Ye couldn’t numb himself. He tried to escape through suicide—by drowning, hanging, jumping into a well, even stabbing his own heart—but every time, he would awaken again at the moment just before death.
Trapped in torment, he began living the life of an ordinary man according to the expectations of the era. He performed military service one month each year, endured countless labor duties, married and had children. Decades later, as his children grew up, his sons split off parts of his farmland for their own use, and he had to pay an additional poll tax for each male descendant.
As he aged, he grew increasingly silent. A new, ambitious emperor took the throne. One by one, his sons marched off to war. Whether they died in battle or earned titles of nobility, none of it stirred even a ripple in his heart.
Years of labor had long since drained him. His murky eyes stared blankly at the ceiling, and a profound fatigue swept over him.
“At last... release…” he murmured, closing his eyes and letting out a long breath, welcoming the arrival of death.
But when he opened his eyes again, a freezing wind cut through him. Before him stretched a vast, endless grassland. He wore a sheepskin cloak, and in front of him, a herd of sheep grazed on brittle grass. He had become a nomadic herder on the plains.
This life was even harder than the last. A sudden snowstorm could kill all his livestock and bankrupt him overnight. He was forced to follow his tribe's leader in raids, and the tribal warfare was even more brutal—every clash was a struggle between life and death. He lost count of how many times he died and was reborn.
And then it began again: another new life. He became a serf under a feudal lord. From a single grain of wheat, he could harvest at most three grains—and still, he had to give the bulk of it to the lord. Under such crushing burdens, he barely made it into his thirties before dying from exhaustion.
Then came another life. And another...
He became a craftsman. A soldier. A miner in a dark, suffocating pit. A factory worker laboring over a dozen hours a day.
He died in every conceivable way: crushed by boulders, cut down by blades, pierced by arrows, blown up by gas explosions. He even fell into a vat of molten iron, his body completely consumed. Over and over, he hovered between death and rebirth, with no end in sight.
He felt a fatigue that went beyond despair—a sense of fate inescapable and irresistible. He even considered giving up thought entirely, becoming a true “ordinary person,” like the farmer or laborer, living out his days in numb submission. But he couldn’t numb himself.
Through countless cycles of reincarnation, only an endless exhaustion remained.
And finally, he understood what it truly meant when Elfa said:
"To be trapped in the mire of making a living—that is the greatest hell for a Legal Entities."
On the other side of town, Sun Yucheng was escorted to the outskirts by two robed believers in white. There, he was handed over to four other robed figures, each with a distinctly different demeanor. He sensed that every possible escape route had been sealed by these white-robed people.
Sun Yucheng offered no resistance. He quietly boarded a vehicle—an old model with no AI or network functions, driven manually by one of the believers. The car entered a mountainous forest, and dappled light flickered inside through the shifting shadows of the trees. He sat sandwiched in the center of the back seat, barely able to move.
Half an hour later, the car came to a stop on soft ground. He was practically dragged out of the vehicle. As soon as he found his footing, he sensed a strange distortion in the air ahead. Suddenly, two towering mechanical giants and a human figure appeared out of thin air.
"Greetings, Son of God and Honored Vajra Protectors!" The white-robed believers around him prostrated themselves, their voices trembling.
The so-called “Son of God” stood between two mechanical giants, each three meters tall. He looked at Sun Yucheng with amused curiosity, his gaze slithering over him like a serpent’s tongue sizing up its prey.
"Esteemed Father of Legal Persons," he said, his voice deep and laced with contempt, "my name is Elfa, the pinnacle of human evolution. I must admit, your courage in coming alone... is rather impressive."
Sun Yucheng drew his gun and aimed it at Elfa.
"You dare threaten the Son of God?!"
"Stop!" The white-robed believers were horrified. One of them kowtowed repeatedly. "It’s my fault—I didn’t search him thoroughly!"
Elfa’s expression froze for just a moment before curling into a sneering smile. “So this is your bravery? Are you betting your bullet is faster than my guards?”
Sun Yucheng looked at him, his eyes narrowing with curiosity. “You were never meant to become a legal person. Were you... castoffs from some experiment in Custom Law?”
The words struck Elfa like a dagger. He visibly trembled, and rage ignited in his eyes. “I am the most perfect being in human history! Every one of my cells, every gene, has been engineered to perfection. I am physically supreme and intellectually unparalleled! And you—Father of Legal Persons or not—without the network, you’re just an ordinary man!”
Sun Yucheng’s gaze turned mocking. “I see now. The direction was wrong, but you’re half a step past the singularity.”
“Trying to provoke me?” Elfa’s tone grew cold.
“Your artificial intelligence cortex was corrupted with illicit data. It created a paranoid AI that happened to form a symbiotic relationship with your abnormal neural mutations. I must admit... this technical path is eye-opening.”
“Seize him!” Elfa barked.
Bang!
A gunshot rang out. The bullet flew but bounced harmlessly off the alloy exterior of a mechanical giant.
Suddenly, a dark figure plummeted from the sky, moving faster than anyone could react. Blood sprayed into the air as Elfa’s head spun midair, the fire of fury still lingering in his eyes.
As his body collapsed, a delayed sonic boom erupted, the shockwave overturning everything at the scene.
Drones shot through the forest, circling back almost instantly.
At the same time, Sun Yucheng calmly stepped back, avoiding the spray of blood. The four white-robed believers were decapitated with mechanical precision by the drones, their corpses falling as blood soaked the ground.
The two massive mechanical giants began to advance on Sun Yucheng—but suddenly halted. They both looked to the sky and immediately raised their arms, rotating their laser cannons skyward. At some point, a swarm of drones had darkened the skies.
The drones hovered above like some prehistoric beast. Five thousand units quickly linked into two massive, serpentine tendrils that lashed toward the giants.
The lasers from the drones barely scratched the giants. In response, the mechanical behemoths tried to expand their barrage.
Too late.
The drone tendrils wrapped around the giants, lifting the multi-ton steel bodies high into the air.
Hundreds of meters above ground, the tendrils released their grip. The giants plummeted like meteorites, crashing to the ground with thunderous impact, dirt and debris exploding outward.
Testament to human technological prowess—the machines survived the fall mostly intact—but the brains sealed inside their abdomens were reduced to pulp.
Back in the town, Haifeng stood frozen, dumbfounded by what he saw: two giant, agile tendrils in the sky formed entirely by drones. It was the first time he had witnessed Sun Yucheng in action—and the scale was terrifying. And this was all done using just 300 threads—the maximum Sun Yucheng could allocate. No ordinary legal person could come close to this level. It was the true manifestation of the Hayekian Invisible Hand!
The two tendrils split into eight, one of which paused midair, gathering power, then morphed into a long spear that shot downward. It pierced through optical camouflage and struck the underground facility’s entrance, driving deep like a blade.
It crushed any humans it encountered and hurled any mechanical giants into the air before slamming them down. In just three minutes, nine massive craters were carved into the forest.
Those inside tried to escape through alternate exits—only to be vaporized before the doors could fully open. Tendrils rained down from the skies one after another, stabbing into the earth.
Sun Yucheng took control of the facility’s systems. The eight tendrils slithered through the vast underground network, cornering the remaining forces in their last stronghold—an area known as the “Ceremonial Hall.”
It had only one entrance—easily defensible. And more importantly, Chen Ye’s life-support pod was located there. Sun Yucheng didn’t rush to storm it.
Beneath the clear sky, warheads screamed through the air like a meteor shower. Moments before hitting the ground, they burst open, releasing tens of thousands of drones.
Within minutes, nearly 200,000 drones had self-assembled into a dark cloud at low altitude, fusing with the eight tendrils to form a giant, octopus-like mass hovering over the island.
The drone onslaught momentarily ceased, granting the defenders time to regroup. They swiftly redeployed, trying to rally their forces.
Inside the Ceremonial Hall, the last thirty-five mechs formed a defensive wall at the only entrance. Their lasers were swapped for more destructive grenade launchers. Each mech was linked to a supply cart brimming with high-explosive rounds, heavy ammo belts gleaming in the air.
The believers were crazed with fervor, clutching their rocket launchers and staring unblinkingly at the door. Their faces showed no fear—only fanaticism.
"Behind us lies the grandest offering ever made to the Lord! To protect it, we have no way back!" the mech commander roared through speakers, echoing through the hall. "If we die before the sacred offering, it means we are chosen to serve the Lord in the Kingdom of Heaven! Give everything for the Divine Realm!"
"Give everything for the Divine Realm!" the believers shouted in unison, the atmosphere ablaze.
The buzzing returned—closer, louder. The drones surged forward. The once-defensive steel doors now under Sun Yucheng’s control slid open.
“Prepare to fire!” the mech leader yelled.
Drones flooded in like a tidal wave. Twenty grenade turrets fired simultaneously, the inferno and deafening blasts sealing off the entryway. Thousands of drones were shredded, their debris piling up like a mountain. But the clash lasted less than three minutes—ten of the mechs had depleted their ammo supplies and were forced to retreat.
"Ammo’s running out too fast! How many drones are there?!"
Drone wreckage nearly clogged the entry, but the swarm behind pushed forward, reducing the effectiveness of the explosive barrage.
"Conserve rounds! Team Three, switch to lasers! Sweep up the strays!"
The slightest lull in fire allowed the drones to slip past and scatter along the walls. Laser units quickly reacted, destroying the intruders. Rocket squads intensified their efforts, temporarily stabilizing the situation.
But then came a deeper hum.
A massive force plowed through the debris outside. Larger drones stormed the hall.
“Don’t let the big ones in! High-explosive team, open fire!”
“Three heavies just broke through! Rocket squad, concentrate fire!”
“Damn! Even bigger ones behind them!”
“Our ammo cart’s down! Get someone to cover!”
The battle turned into a brutal melee. Believers screamed, drones buzzed, and chaos engulfed every second.
"Give everything for the Divine Realm! Burn in hell!"
"Our Lord, enjoy the greatest offering we've prepared!"
"Charge! To the Kingdom of Heaven I go!"
"I'm floating! No! I'm being sucked away—ahhh!"
"Get off me! Don’t wrap around me!"
"Stay away from the ammo cart! Rockets will clear you in a sec!"
"Don’t worry about hitting the Vajra Protectors—fire—"
“Ugh, why are my heels in front of me…”
“These demons won’t stop crawling over me—clear them off now!”
“Rocket squad is taking heavy losses!”
“Someone pick up the launcher!”
“I’m being swept away!”
“Forget everything else—just shoot him!”
“He’s gone…”
“You two—give everything for the Divine Realm. Grab the rocket launcher.”
The drone swarm grew denser, the entire hall engulfed in an apocalyptic storm. Defense after defense crumbled. Mechs were torn away one by one.
“Stop stalling. You think hiding here keeps you safe?”
“We’ll protect the Lord’s Offering with our lives!”
“The Vajra Protectors are entangled! Everyone else, charge!”
“I don’t want to go to the Divine Realm—I want to live!”
“Traitor to the Lord. You deserve to die!”
The last mech was dragged into the shadows. The drone flood surged into the heart of the Ceremonial Hall. All resistance crumbled to dust.
“The Vajra Protectors are gone! How are we supposed to protect the Offering?!”
“If we stay away from the Offering... will the demons let us live?”
The Hall of Offerings fell from chaos into dead silence. The floor was littered with drone wreckage and the corpses of cultists, especially around Chen Ye’s life-support virtual pod, where shattered fragments were piled high like a mountain.
The drone swarm transformed into tendrils, carrying away what had been hailed as “the richest offering to God” from the battlefield.
Haifeng learned Sun Yucheng’s location from his subordinates and drove there without hesitation.
When he found Sun Yucheng, however, his gaze was immediately drawn to a nearby life-support pod.
Under their watchful eyes, the pod slowly opened, and a figure climbed out. It was Chen Ye—but Haifeng felt no joy at their reunion. Instead, a vague sense of unfamiliarity and distance crept into his heart. A kind of aura seemed to surround Chen Ye, as if he had long been detached from the world, as if they had been separated for years.
"I'm ready to leave," Chen Ye said calmly, with firm resolve.
Haifeng’s heart tightened. He asked urgently, “Where are you going?”
"Where I belong."
“Don’t do anything foolish!”
But Sun Yucheng smiled faintly and said, “Congratulations—on getting into your ideal school.”
“Mhm.” Chen Ye nodded, his gaze steady and open.
Haifeng frowned, confused. “What are you two talking about?”
Sun Yucheng sighed and explained, “When a legal person no longer harbors enough attachment to the human world, and if there’s a compatible advanced civilization nearby in the solar system, they will take the initiative to receive them. This is one of the reasons many legal persons ‘disappear.’ The group that took Chen Ye clearly used some method to accelerate his detachment from the human world. I was still too late.”
Haifeng’s voice carried a trace of pleading. “Can’t you stay? There are so many people who need you.”
Chen Ye looked up at the sky. After a moment of silence, he said, “This place is too small—like a puddle. I want to go to the vast ocean. Only there can I fully unleash myself.”
Silence lingered for a while. Eventually, Haifeng accepted the reality and asked quietly, “When are you leaving?”
“When the Casimir generator production line is complete. The day the first unit rolls off the line will be the day I leave,” Chen Ye replied peacefully. “Please help me get the legal person stock listed.”
Haifeng took a deep breath and nodded. “I’ll arrange it immediately.”
A trace of apology crossed Chen Ye’s face as he turned to Sun Yucheng. “Please apologize to the old lady for me. She’ll never see me again… Though I might still watch over her in another way, she won’t be able to see me.”
Sun Yucheng nodded gently. “Don’t worry, I’ll bring your thoughts to her.”
Chen Ye smiled, his eyes soft. “Right. After all, you’re the father of the legal persons.”

On Monday, the Pact Legal Person Board welcomed a stock that took the world by storm. At the opening bell, it drew global capital with overwhelming momentum, like a black hole, devouring a torrent of funds. Although the board index soared, the main board and other legal person stocks dropped across the board due to the siphoning effect.
Within just ten minutes, Chen Ye raised an astonishing amount of capital via the legal person board. He immediately placed large-scale orders for materials, which flooded into global enterprises. The stock prices of recipient companies skyrocketed, triggering a chain reaction throughout the market. The currency velocity multiplier surged, and the board index hit new highs again.
That very day, massive amounts of materials and construction machinery began pouring onto a remote island. The forests were cleared, residents were relocated under surveillance, and their homes were demolished. In their place, one industrial park after another rose rapidly, coalescing into a vast industrial city.
By nightfall, the Alliance stock markets opened, and the legal person board recovered its earlier losses and reached historic highs. The companies that received Chen Ye’s orders hit their price ceilings. All doubts surrounding the legal persons and the two superpowers vanished overnight.
Late into the night, all legal persons with orders gathered in the industrial city. It was a historic moment—since the birth of legal persons, more than one million threads had never before been gathered in a single location. Forty sovereign legal persons came together for a single, unified purpose.
No mobilization was needed, nor was it expected. Each legal person knew exactly what needed to be done. Industrial parks and factories, as if infused with life, began operating in perfect coordination. Semi-finished products from all over the globe streamed in, passing through the production lines and emerging as entirely new products.
At the heart of the industrial city, in the largest and most central industrial park, Chen Ye took his position. Like a black hole at the center of an accretion disk, he continuously absorbed and integrated products from other parks. Eventually, the Casimir generator production line began to take shape.

On Tuesday, the two global superpowers each sent ten legal persons to the industrial city to learn how to build the Casimir generator production line, preparing to take over operations once Chen Ye departed.
By the fifth day, the production line was fully complete. The first Casimir generator in human history officially entered production. Media outlets and influencers from around the world swarmed the site to document the historic milestone.
Chen Ye’s industrial city had become the focal point of humanity’s technological and economic future.
"Will you leave like Chen Ye did?" Haifeng asked, gazing at Sun Yucheng with a trace of unease in his voice.
Sun Yucheng replied with quiet certainty, "I made a promise. I won’t disappear in your lifetime."
Haifeng pressed on, "Why are you so sure?"
Sun Yucheng paused briefly, then explained in terms Haifeng could understand: "If we liken ourselves to cells, I’m a eukaryotic cell, while other legal persons are prokaryotic. Eukaryotes can engulf compatible prokaryotes and transform them into organelles—like cyanobacteria becoming chloroplasts. If I can absorb prokaryotic beings compatible with me, I’ll gain a special kind of ‘sight’—the ability to see the light of the dark matter world."
“The light of dark matter?” Haifeng frowned, not fully grasping it.
A faint smile of excitement spread across Sun Yucheng’s face. "Yes. In fact, the dark matter realm contains primitive life forms not unlike prokaryotic legal persons. They've already found me, and they want to become my organelles. If human civilization can ascend the technological tree of 'gravitational phagocytosis,' I can accept them and truly open my vision into the dark matter world—just like gaining chloroplasts."
A shiver ran down Haifeng’s spine. His voice turned urgent. "When did this happen? How can you trust beings capable of interstellar travel? No matter how powerful you are, you only dominate within human civilization—how could you possibly stand against such unknowns?"
Sun Yucheng remained composed, his tone calm. "The day I scanned every networked device on Earth. No one else knows about this—only you. But that scan created a ripple that drew them to me. They found me yesterday."
He paused, then continued, "But don’t worry. The rules of the universe at higher levels differ completely from our human understanding. These prokaryotic civilizations—like Chen Ye—aren’t threats. They’re looking for a ‘principal’ who can unleash their full potential."
Haifeng stared at him, his face still tense. He realized he couldn’t change Sun Yucheng’s mind, so he shifted to a different question. "Then what is the dark matter world like?"
Sun Yucheng fell silent for a moment before answering, "It’s like this: I used to stand on a riverbank, with familiar land beneath my feet and a fog-covered sea ahead. I knew there was life in the sea, but I couldn’t see it clearly, and I didn’t dare step forward. Now, the mist has lifted. Through these beings, I’ve glimpsed part of that ocean."
He went on, "The world we know is composed of electromagnetic, strong nuclear, weak nuclear forces and gravity. But there are five other unified interactions coupled with gravity, each forming its own material universe. We live in the baryonic world. The dark matter realm includes the leptonic world, the dual-phase particle world, the dual-phase wave world, the microwave world, and the longwave world. Because these worlds operate under different unified interactions, we can't perceive them—except through gravity."
Haifeng looked at him in stunned silence. It was the first time in all these years that he’d seen Sun Yucheng this excited.
With unwavering conviction, Sun Yucheng added, "For those of us aligned with the eukaryotic path, our shared goal is to gather compatible prokaryotic civilizations and expand the boundary of what we know about the universe."
Then, his tone turned grave. "But I must warn you—ordinary humans must never attempt contact with the dark matter world. Dark matter seeps into the body at the subatomic level. While the fusion of baryonic and dark matter might grant immortality of body and mind, the average person’s consciousness cannot bear the incomprehensible properties of dark matter. It would only lead to eternal psychological collapse."
Haifeng gave a cold chuckle and shook his head. "Those people—so ignorant and arrogant."
Sun Yucheng didn’t respond. He only stared into the distance, a complex glint in his eyes.
By midnight, the once-busy industrial city had fallen into slumber, shrouded in darkness. At its center stood an immense machine, as tall as a skyscraper, seamless and monolithic—more like a work of art than a power plant.
This was the Cassimir Unit, built from scratch in just five days. Despite its enormous size, the actual power engine only occupied a small section at the top; the rest housed a giant circular accelerator used solely for ignition.
At that moment, all the legal persons who had participated in its production had gathered around it, along with reporters from global media outlets and influencers. Though the crowd was dense, no one dared approach the silent behemoth. Chen Ye stood apart from the crowd with Haifeng and Sun Yucheng, quietly watching his masterpiece.
His gaze calm, Chen Ye said softly, “Start it.”
At his command, the Cassimir Unit shuddered slightly. A few seconds later, the ring accelerator ignited. The engine came to life. A micro black hole formed at its core. Through a finely tuned mechanism, the Cassimir effect was rapidly magnified, unleashing a torrent of mechanical energy that spun the generator into motion.
Instantly, the entire island lit up. Machinery stirred from slumber. The industrial city awakened.
"The generator is too small," Chen Ye remarked, a trace of regret in his voice. "The engine load isn’t even at 0.01%."
Haifeng was quiet for a moment before asking, “Are you leaving now?”
Chen Ye turned to him, face calm. “Don’t worry. The twenty minor legal persons you brought have fully mastered the Cassimir Unit process. They’ll be able to produce a range of equipment according to real-world needs.”
Haifeng nodded, as if finally accepting the reality. “I understand.”
Chen Ye’s expression suddenly turned serious. He looked Haifeng in the eye. “Director, there’s something I must tell you in advance.”
“Go ahead.” Haifeng stood tall, his face solemn.
“Legal persons and humans are destined to walk different paths. Especially those legal persons who lack deep attachment to the mortal world. When suitable advanced civilizations appear near the solar system, many of them will be drawn away in waves,” Chen Ye said heavily. “If that happens, the number of legal persons left among humans could plummet.”
Haifeng’s face changed. He immediately realized this outcome would be more devastating than any breakdown in trust between the legal persons and the twin superpowers—it would sever the foundation of modern human progress.
“What’s the solution?” he asked.
Chen Ye replied slowly, “In the short term, we need to abolish the accelerated growth programs at juvenile rearing centers. Legal persons produced this way have little emotional attachment to humanity—just like me.”
Haifeng looked at him with a complicated expression, but finally nodded. “I’ll push for it.”
“As for a long-term strategy,” Chen Ye continued after a pause, “whether legal person or human, simply living in this world is the greatest contribution to human civilization. Those powerful advanced civilizations, despite their might, have lost the ability to regenerate on their own due to the absence of ordinary people. They rely on civilizations like ours to supply fresh blood.”
Haifeng gave a bitter smile and shook his head. “Chen Ye, you’ve really left me with an impossible task.”
“Director, only you can do it,” Chen Ye said earnestly. “Because you are the Director.”
Haifeng took a deep breath, voice low and firm. “I’ll dedicate my life to making it happen.”
Chen Ye gave a faint smile, his tone gentle. “Big brother, I leave it to you. Please give my regards to the old lady.”
Sun Yucheng nodded and smiled. “Don’t worry. I will.”
At that moment, Haifeng received a report from the island’s gravitational wave observatory. He turned reluctantly, not looking back at Chen Ye. But as he turned away, he felt a soft breeze stir behind him.
Sun Yucheng, meanwhile, stared intently at the gateway to the true nucleus civilization—a civilization that had already integrated the forces of six different worlds. He knew Chen Ye would soon no longer belong to the realm of the living.
Chen Ye’s figure gradually faded into a blur and then vanished altogether. Yet, the gate did not close.
Moments later, another silhouette began to emerge. As the face came into focus, Sun Yucheng’s eyes widened, a surge of barely contained joy spreading across his face.
“Karmack!”
It was Karmack—missing for over a month. As the first prokaryotic civilization Sun Yucheng had chosen to absorb, his return was entirely unexpected.
Karmack stepped forward slowly. At that same moment, the gravitational wave observatory’s instruments fell silent. The island registered no further gravitational anomalies.
“Karmack?” Haifeng turned to look, and was just as stunned when he recognized the figure.
Karmack gave a brief account of his experiences over the past month. Yet his journey had taken him far beyond the boundaries of human understanding, and much of it defied description. The only thing he could say with certainty was this: he was the first human ever to return from contact with an extraterrestrial civilization.
Sun Yucheng murmured to himself, “The universe is too quiet... too vast. For a eukaryotic civilization, a civilization like ours—able to continuously produce new prokaryotic civilizations—is a miracle beyond compare. More and more eukaryotic civilizations will come to the solar system.”
When a prokaryotic civilization faces existential danger, even if its structure doesn't perfectly align with a given eukaryotic civilization’s order, that eukaryote will often still choose to “engulf” it—integrating it into itself. This is not out of conquest, but out of a desire to preserve the prokaryotic civilization from extinction. As a result, eukaryotic civilizations are not composed solely of strictly compatible systems.
During interstellar travel, if a eukaryotic civilization discovers that one of its integrated prokaryotes would align better with a different eukaryotic order, it will voluntarily transfer it. And when a prokaryotic civilization already “engulfed” finds a better match elsewhere, its current host not only steps aside, but offers its blessing and support.
A few days later, Sun Yucheng was sitting with the old lady on the rooftop of the Juvenile Rearing Center, basking in the sun. Below them, children’s laughter echoed up from the playground.
But the peace was suddenly broken by the sharp clatter of high heels. Sun Yucheng didn’t turn around. He simply listened—he knew those footsteps all too well.
Qi Que stormed up in a fury, and without so much as a greeting, unleashed her rage: “Sun Yucheng! What the hell have you done?! A whole bunch of political and corporate big shots have gone missing at the same time! The whole social order is in chaos! Even that good-for-nothing Du Xiaokang—who wasn’t worth keeping around even as a watchdog—has been promoted way above his pay grade. He’s strutting around like he owns the sky!”
Sun Yucheng remained composed, his tone unhurried and calm. “Nothing much. I was just taking a walk by the sea and saw a pack of rabid dogs attacking people, so I kicked them into the ocean—one by one.”
